# Twincat-BinaryTool

Twincat and ADS is from Beckhoff Â©. I'm not affiliated.

The Binary Tool is a tool to read, write and convert a buffer.

It is written for Beckhoff Twincat 2.11 or higher.

In TwinCat 3, the implementation can be solved more elegantly. It is therefore not intended for TwinCat 3.



### It was created as an aid to the implementation of the InfluxDB library. It is inspired by Aapo Vuoristo on Aapo TwinCAT Pages
